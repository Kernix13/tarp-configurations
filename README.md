# Tarp Configurations Project

My 3rd portfolio project using React and Tailwind.

This is a simple app that computes the tarp sizes you can use for 21 types of Tarp shelters. If you are not into Bushcraft, then I'm sure you are thinking...

> WHAAAAAT?

This is another project for myself since I practice bushcraft and wilderness survival techniques.

## Features

For the time being I have a `Calcs` page which shows all the calculations for the tarp configurations. I may remove that page if it doesn't make sense to have it.
